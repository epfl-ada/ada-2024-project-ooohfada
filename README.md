# Title

## Abstract

A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

In this project, we take on the role of community managers helping a YouTuber recover from a recent public relations crisis. Our goal is to develop a data-driven strategy for navigating the aftermath of cancel culture using insights from YouTube’s ecosystem. Drawing on patterns from previous YouTuber experiences, we’ll analyze key metrics—such as channel type and the creator’s perceived integrity—to offer tailored strategies for re-engagement. Should they issue an apology video? Wait a specific period before posting new content? Our recommendations will not be based on the cause of their cancellation but on the optimal tactics for handling its impact.

Our motivation stems from the rapid spread of cancel culture, which impacts creators on YouTube and beyond. We aim to provide practical insights for creators facing backlash, helping them make calculated decisions about their next steps to rebuild audience trust or lean into controversy if strategically beneficial.
