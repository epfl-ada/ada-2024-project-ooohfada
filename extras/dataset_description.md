## Scripts

We provide two jupyter notebooks along with the dataset:

- `preprocessing.ipynb`: which replicates
- `analyses.ipynb`: which reproduces the plots in the associated paper.

## Channel Data

The file `df_channels_en.tsv.gz` contains data related to channels.
It aggregates both basic stats from channels obtained from `channelcrawler.com`,
as well as rankings obtained from `socialblade.com`.

- `category_cc`: category of the channel.
- `join_date`: join date of the channel.
- `channel`: channel id.
- `name_cc`: name of the channel.
- `subscribers_cc`: number of subscribers.
- `videos_cc`: number of videos.
- `subscriber_rank_sb`: rank in terms of number of subscribers.
- `weights`: weights cal

Some facts about it:

- This dataframe has 136,470 rows, where each one corresponds to a different channel.
- We obtained all channels with >10k subscribers and >10 videos from `channelcrawler.com` in the 27 October 2019.
- Additionally we filtered all channels that were not in english given their video metadata (see `Raw Channels').

## Time Series Data

The file `df_timeseries_en.csv.gz` contains data related to time series.
We have a data point for each channel and each week:

- `channel`: channel id.
- `category`: category of the channel as assigned by `socialblade.com` according to the last 10 videos at time of crawl.
- `datetime`: Week related to the data point.
- `views`: Total number of views the channel had this week.
- `delta_views`: Delta views obtained this week.
- `subs`: Total number of subscribers the channel had this week.
- `delta_subs`: Delta subscribers obtained this week.
- `videos`: Total number of videos the channel had this week.
- `delta_videos`: Delta videos obtained this week.
- `activity`: Number of videos published in the last 15 days.

Some facts about it:

- This file contains 18,872,499 data points belonging to 153,550 channels.
- In average, it contains 2.8 years of data for each channel
- Data goes from early January 2015 to the end of September 2019. Not all channels have the complete time frame.
- Additionally we filtered all channels that were not in english given their video metadata (see `Raw Channels').

## Video Metadata

The file `yt_metadata_en.jsonl.gz` contains metadata data related to ~73M videos from ~137k channels.
Below we show the data recorded for each of the video

    {
        'categories': 'People & Blogs',
        'channel_id': 'UCzzYnZ8GIzfB1Vr3hk2Nj9Q',
        'crawl_date': '2019-11-02 09:01:05.328421',
        'description': 'See more at http://www.standstrongcompany.com Fitness Keep it healthy at (...)',
        'dislike_count': 8,
        'display_id': 'x72dBgcVPFI',
        'duration': 187,
        'like_count': 91,
        'tags': 'Tiger Fitness,TigerFitness,fitness,workout,diet,health,pre workout,ab workout,(...)',
        'title': 'Slingshot for Squats? | Tiger Fitness',
        'upload_date': '2019-04-21 00:00:00',
        'view_count': 2559
    }

Some facts about it:

- This data was crawled from YouTube between 2019-10-29 and 2019-11-23.
- It contains 72,924,794 videos created between 2005-05-24 to 2019-11-20.

## Comment data

The file `youtube_comments.tsv.gz` contains metadata data related to ~8.6B comments made by ~449M users in 20.5M videos.
Each rows corresponds to a comment.
It contains an anonymized user id, a video id, the number of replies the comment received, and the number of likes the comment received.

| author | video_id    | likes | replies |
| :----- | :---------- | :---- | ------: |
| 1      | Gkb1QMHrGvA | 2     |       0 |
| 1      | CNtp0xqoods | 0     |       0 |

| 3      | o7W2fdWXnPc | 0     |       0 |

Some facts about it:

- We only make available comments for videos with more than 30 comments.

## Raw files (pre-language filtering)

Additionally, we provide raw files.
These have the same names as the remaining files but:
a) have the prefix `_raw_` attached to them and;
b) do not have the suffix `_en` before the name extension.

## Helper file

The large `.json` file associated with video metadata can be quite painful to deal with.
With that in mind, we also provide a helper (`yt_metadata_helper.feather`).
This DataFrame contains the same fields as `df_videos_raw.jsonl.gz`,
except `description`, `tags`, and `title` (the largest fields).
Feather is a language-agnostic portable file that can be easily loaded in Python or R (see [here][feather]).
